👋 Hi there! I'm CodeNameHannah, a junior software developer in training with a passion for backend development. 🚀

🧠 Transitioned from a background in business administration and economics to pursue my true calling in information technology.

💻 Currently, I'm sharpening my skills in Java and SQL, diving deep into the world of backend development. I'm excited about building robust and scalable systems that power the digital world.

📚 Learning is my superpower, and I believe that every line of code I write is an opportunity to grow. I'm a firm believer in the "never stop learning" philosophy.

🌐 On a mission to make the internet a better place, one line of code at a time. If you share a passion for coding, backend magic, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out! Let's learn and build together. 🤝

🌟 Open to collaborations and always eager to contribute to exciting projects. Check out my repositories below and let's create some amazing software together! 🚀
